Project #1 - Figma of Your Life

We were tasked to first make a model on Figma about ourselves. Once approved, we then had to use bootstrap to create a site with a minimum of 3 pages. 

Peer Review: Alexander Soria
Your pages are set up decently. Nice job with the carousel, Really cool that it's changing slides automatically. I also really like the accordions you did for your Interests page, saving up some room while giving the user an option to click on it to read more info about you. 
Now there are some issues present that I feel should be addressed. In your home page, there is one image in your carousel that doesn't match the sizes of the other images. Your footer where you display your social media links could benefit a bit with a container so it isn't scrunched up against the left edge of the screen. In your Accomplishments page, it looks a little off that your cards are up against the navbar, as well as the lack of formatting for the cards in general as they are all over the place. I had this issue, too, and one of the solutions I used was adding a Card Group to set them evenly (see the bottom of the Cards page in the Bootstrap documentation). Overall, you did alright, nice job!
