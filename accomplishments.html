                      <p class="card-text">This was my first ever trophy I've earned from playing hockey. The game was very close and we won 5-4. Our team wanted this win so badly because the opposing goalie kept trashtalking and saying how we were gonna lose. There was no better feeling than scoring on that guy. I was on the point and shot it low and it got blocked by a defender, but the rebound came right back to me and I shot it low and it snuck in past the goalie. Suck it Tyler! The guy who scored the game winner for us was this older guy named Tony who had never scored before, so that made the win even better.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">This was supposed to be a triathlon, but unfortunately the water in the lake had some kind of bacteria contamination so we were not allowed to swim. They replaced the 200m swim a mile run. The first section was a 1/2 mile sprint, then a 4 mile bike ride, and then finally with a mile run. I finished 10th out of 80 people, despite riding my dad's 50 lb mountain bike, while everyone else had their own super-light racing bikes. I trained for this for many months, so it was very satisfying to finish with good times. </p>

                      <p class="card-text">Growing some muscle and progressing in the gym to me is one of my favorite accomplishments. I've really dedicated a lot of time in the past 2 and a half years to working out. I've been really consistent with going 3 days in a row with a push, pull, legs schedule and then taking a day off for rest. My favorite exercise is probably the dumbbell incline bench press or dumbbell lateral raise, because both give me an insane pump that boosts my dopamine a ton. I also love the leg extension machine and take pride in never skipping leg day. Going to the gym has probably been the best decision I've ever made. </p>
