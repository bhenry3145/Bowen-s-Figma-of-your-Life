It reminds me of Prison Architect but with space colonists who need to develop the technology to build a spaceship to leave the planet they are stranded on. </div> <img src="./assets/rimworld.jpg" alt="Picture of the cover of Rimworld">

One day I was at my friend's house and he had it laying on the table and I asked to play it. After creating my Argonian named Rafael, my adventure was on. I must've played it for like 10 hours straight at my friend's house, which was pretty rude now looking back. I bought my own copy after I went home and then beat the game like a week later. Despite the Bethesda bugs, I loved the lore and story and all of the characters you meet in the game.</div> <img src="./assets/oblivion.jpg" alt="Picture of the cover of Oblivion">

My grandpa bought me a copy and right away I played it so much. I even met one of my only online friends on there during a random game and we still play other video games today. However, due to EA's greediness and their lack of innovation since NHL 14, I am reluctant to buy another NHL game.</div> <img src="./assets/nhl.jpg" alt="Picture of the cover of NHL 14">
